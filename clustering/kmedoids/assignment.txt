1) What is the primary difference between K-Means and K-Medoids in terms of how they choose cluster centers?

2) Why is the silhouette score used to evaluate clustering performance, and what does a higher score indicate?

3) Why is K-Medoids generally considered more robust to outliers compared to K-Means?

4) Which algorithm (K-Means or K-Medoids) is computationally more efficient, and why?

5) In what scenarios would K-Medoids perform significantly better than K-Means?

6) How can you visually determine if K-Medoids provides better clustering than K-Means?

7) If clusters in a dataset have overlapping boundaries, how does it affect the performance of K-Means and K-Medoids?

8) What types of datasets (e.g., categorical, numerical, mixed) are better suited for K-Medoids rather than K-Means?
