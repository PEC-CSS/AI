# URL Logging For AI WebScraper

This code adds a URL logging feature. The scraper retrieves information from the internet using an AI agent. 
 

## How It Works  
1. Saves every unique URL visited during a session in a `logs/urls_log.csv` file.  
2. Every time a URL is visited, it is logged directly within the script.  
3. If the URL is already logged in the session, it will not be added again.  
4. The log file is easy to read and stored in the `logs` folder.  
5. Adds a timestamp next to each URL for reference.
