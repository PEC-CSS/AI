# QA Model Comparison

Welcome to the **QA Model Comparison** section! This folder explores various Question Answering (QA) models, comparing their effectiveness using a common dataset. By applying multiple methods, you will gain insights into how different QA approaches perform in real-world scenarios.

**Note**: This section is designed for learners who want to understand how different QA models work and how to evaluate their performance. While it covers key methodologies, advanced tuning techniques are beyond the scope of this comparison.

## üìÇ Structure

This folder includes:
- **Rule-Based QA (TF-IDF + BM25)**: Traditional information retrieval-based QA techniques.
- **Extractive QA (BERT, RoBERTa)**: Transformer-based models that extract answers from given text.
- **Generative QA (T5, GPT-4)**: Models that generate responses rather than extracting them.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Compare models using Exact Match (EM), F1-score, and response coherence.

Each section includes **assignments** to help reinforce your understanding, along with **solutions** for self-assessment.

## üèÅ Getting Started

1. **Begin with Rule-Based QA**: Implement TF-IDF and BM25 to retrieve answers.
2. **Move to Extractive Models**: Use BERT or RoBERTa to extract precise answers.
3. **Explore Generative Models**: Try T5 or GPT-4 for a more flexible QA approach.
4. **Compare Performance**: Evaluate models based on EM, F1-score, and coherence.

Happy learning! Understanding these techniques will help you choose the right QA model for different scenarios. For further learning, refer to the documentation and tutorials linked above.
