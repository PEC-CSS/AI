# AI Workshop Code Repository

Welcome to the AI Workshop Code Repository!  
This repository is designed as a beginner-friendly, comprehensive guide to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) concepts, perfect for newcomers or those looking to deepen their understanding. Whether you’re attending our workshops or self-studying, this collection provides you with everything you need to get started with AI and ML.

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized into various folders, each dedicated to a specific topic or algorithm, designed to offer a structured, step-by-step learning path. Each folder includes:

- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Practical implementations of algorithms with explanations, covering a range of beginner to intermediate concepts in AI and ML.
- **Assignments:** Carefully designed assignments to reinforce your understanding of each topic.
- **Solutions:** Solutions to assignments to help guide you through the learning process.
- **Resources:** Each folder includes a dedicated README file with curated links to supplementary articles, videos, and tutorials that will deepen your understanding of each topic.

## Getting Started

### 1. Setting Up Your Environment
To get started with the code, you’ll need a Python environment with essential libraries like NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib. We recommend using Anaconda or Jupyter Notebook for a smooth experience.

### 2. Topics Covered
This repository covers a variety of AI/ML topics, such as:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Learn to clean and prepare data for ML models.
- **Model Tuning:** Learn to optimize hyperparameters to improve a machine learning model's performance.
- **Supervised Learning:** Implementation of algorithms like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Explore Clustering techniques like K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and Dimensionality Reduction.
- **Neural Networks and Deep Learning:** Introduction to concepts like Perceptrons, Feedforward Networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Basics of text processing, feature extraction, and text classification.
- **Model Evaluation:** Techniques for evaluating model performance, such as confusion matrices, accuracy, and precision-recall.

### 3. Learning Path
Each folder is structured to build on the previous one. We recommend going through the folders in sequence for a smooth learning experience.

## Resources and Additional Reading
Each folder contains a README file with carefully selected resources, including:

- **Articles:** Introductory and advanced articles to understand the theoretical background.
- **Videos:** Visual aids to reinforce the concepts.
- **Notebooks:** Links to other example notebooks and code snippets to enhance your understanding.
