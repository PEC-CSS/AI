# Deep Computer Vision

Welcome to the **Deep Computer Vision** portion! This folder contains resources and guides to help you build essential skills in Image Processing and Deep Computer Vision. These skills are crucial for working with images and videos in Machine Learning and Deep Learning applications.

**Note**: These notebooks are designed for beginners. They cover the foundational concepts but do not cover all available methods or advanced techniques. For a deeper understanding, please refer to the recommended authentic and offical resources.

## 📂 Structure

This folder currenly includes:
- **Autoencoders**: Type of Neural Network used for Unsupervised Machine Learning tasks.

Each section contains **assignments** to reinforce your understanding, along with **solutions** for self-assessment.

## 🔗 Learning Flow
