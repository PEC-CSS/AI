# Data Preprocessing

Welcome to the **Data Preprocessing** section! This folder contains resources and guides to help you build essential data preprocessing skills. These skills are crucial for understanding, cleaning, and preparing data before using it in machine learning and data analysis tasks.

**Note**: The notebooks here are designed for beginners. They introduce foundational concepts but do not cover all available methods or advanced techniques. For a deeper understanding, please refer to the recommended authentic resources provided in each section.

## üìÇ Structure

This folder currently includes:
- **NumPy & Pandas**: Core libraries for data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Data Visualization**: Learn how to visually represent data insights effectively.

Each section contains **assignments** to reinforce your understanding, along with **solutions** for self-assessment.
