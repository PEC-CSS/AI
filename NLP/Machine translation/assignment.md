# Machine Translation ‚Äì Beginner Coding Assignment

This assignment introduces you to machine translation using a small English‚ÄìFrench dataset. You will write code to translate sentences, compare results, and evaluate the quality of your model‚Äôs translations using BLEU scores.

---

## üìò Sample Dataset

Use the following sentence pairs for translation and evaluation:

| English                        | French                          |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| I love learning languages.     | J'aime apprendre les langues.    |
| Where is the nearest bank?     | O√π est la banque la plus proche ? |
| I need a doctor.               | J'ai besoin d'un m√©decin.        |
| Can you help me?               | Pouvez-vous m'aider ?            |
| The weather is nice today.     | Il fait beau aujourd'hui.        |
| I am hungry.                   | J'ai faim.                       |

## üõ†Ô∏è Tasks

1. **Choose and use a machine translation model** (e.g., from Hugging Face).
2. Write code to translate each English sentence into French.
3. Compare your output with the provided French translations.
4. Calculate the **BLEU score** for each pair of translations.
5. Answer the questions below based on your observations.

## ‚ùì Questions to Answer

1. Did the model's translations exactly match the reference translations?
2. Which translation was the most accurate?
3. Which translation was the most different?
4. What were the BLEU scores for each sentence?
5. Which sentence had the highest BLEU score? Which had the lowest?
6. Does a high BLEU score always mean the translation is better? Why or why not?
7. Were there any issues with grammar, word order, or meaning in your translations?
8. What did you learn about how machines perform translation?
9. What are some strengths and weaknesses of the model you used?

## üß† Bonus

Try translating these extra sentences and evaluate them as well:

- "She is reading a book."
- "It is raining today."

Write down their French translations and BLEU scores.

**Reminder:** You are expected to write the code on your own. This is meant to help you understand how machine translation models work and how to evaluate them.
