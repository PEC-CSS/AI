# NLP

Welcome to the **Natural Language Processing** section! This folder provides an introduction to NLP techniques, which are essential for processing and analyzing human language. NLP allows us to extract insights from text data, making it an integral part of tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and more.

**Note**: The notebooks here are designed for beginners. They introduce foundational concepts but do not cover all available processing methods or advanced techniques. For a more comprehensive understanding, please refer to the recommended resources provided below.

## üìÇ Structure

This folder currently includes:

- **Sentiment Analysis**: A detailed introduction to sentiment analysis, covering its techniques and applications.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Compare traditional rule-based QA (TF-IDF + BM25), extractive models (BERT, RoBERTa), and generative models (T5, GPT-4) using Exact Match (EM), F1-score, and response coherence.
