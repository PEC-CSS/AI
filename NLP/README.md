# NLP

Welcome to the **Natural Language Processing** section! This folder provides an introduction to NLP techniques, which are essential for processing and analyzing human language. NLP allows us to extract insights from text data, making it an integral part of tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and more.

**Note**: The notebooks here are designed for beginners. They introduce foundational concepts but do not cover all available processing methods or advanced techniques. For a more comprehensive understanding, please refer to the recommended resources provided below.

## üîó Learning Flow

Follow these steps to build a strong foundation in NLP techniques:

### 1. **Intro to NLP**
   - **Purpose**: Understand what NLP is, its scope, and its importance.
   - **Topics to Cover**:
     -What is NLP?
     -Core components of NLP: Tokenization, Named Entity Recognition, Part-of-Speech tagging, and Lemmatization.


### 2. **Text Preprocessing**
   - **Purpose**: Preprocess raw text for machine learning models.


### 3. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - **Purpose**: Analyze text data to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).
   - **Topics to Cover**:
     -What is sentiment analysis and why is it important?
     -Types of sentiment analysis: Binary, Multi-class, Fine-grained.
    -Text pre-processing specific to sentiment analysis.
    -Approaches to sentiment analysis:
         a. Rule-based methods (e.g., Lexicon-based methods)
         b. Machine learning methods (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM)
         c. Deep learning methods (e.g., LSTM, BERT)
