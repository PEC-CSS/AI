# Model Tuning

Welcome to the **Model Tuning** section! This folder provides an introduction to hyperparameter tuning, a crucial process in optimizing machine learning models. By systematically adjusting model parameters, you can improve performance and achieve better accuracy. We will cover different tuning strategies such as Grid Search, Random Search, and Bayesian Optimization.

**Note**: The notebooks here are designed for beginners. They introduce fundamental concepts but do not cover all tuning methods or advanced techniques. For more in-depth learning, refer to the recommended resources provided below.

## üìÇ Structure

This folder currently includes:
- **Bayesian Optimization**: A sequential model-based optimization technique that builds a probabilistic model (often using Gaussian Processes) to identify the optimal hyperparameters.
- **Grid Search**: A hyperparameter tuning method that exhaustively tests all possible combinations of hyperparameters within a specified grid to find the optimal set.
- **Random Search**: A hyperparameter tuning method that samples random combinations of hyperparameters to find the best model performance.
- **Grid Search for SVM**: A practical implementation of GridSearchCV for tuning the hyperparameters of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model on the Wine Quality dataset.
- **Early Stopping in DNN**: A technique to prevent overfitting in Deep Neural Networks by halting training when the validation loss stops improving, demonstrated using the CIFAR-10 dataset.
